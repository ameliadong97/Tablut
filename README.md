# Tablut
Comp424 Project

This is an individual class project that I have done for Artificial Intelligence class (Comp424 - Winter 2018). 

Tablut is a variant of the ancient Tafl games, which requires two players (the
Muscovites and the Swedes) to play on a 9x9 board. We were asked to implement moves for both Muscovites and Swedes, and the programs submitted would then be played one match against every other program submitted by other students.
